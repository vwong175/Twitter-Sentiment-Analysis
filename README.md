# What this project is about

This R project was an experiment into data science from my intro to data science class, EAS 345. For this project, I learned the basics of R, dplyr, and the EDA process. I wanted to challenge myself with conducting data analytics on text, specifically twitter tweets on #DonaldTrump, extracting the most popular words people associated him with and the sentiment with how they thought of him.

## Downloading Dataset

The dataset I used was USA 2020 Political Tweets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets?resource=download)

## Usage

1. Download one of the csv files in the link specified above and then run the R code choosing the downloaded file. The first part will clean the csv file, "tweets" column and make a new column named "clean_tweet" as well as write a new csv file of the cleaned data. The second portion of this code will plot and graph analytics in regards to the frequency of tweets over time as well as sentiment analysis of the most popular terms used graphed in an ordered bar chart and word cloud.
