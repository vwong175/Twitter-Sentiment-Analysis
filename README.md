# What this project is about

This R project was an experiment into data science from my intro to data science class, EAS 345. For this project, I learned the basics of R, dplyr, and the EDA process. I wanted to challenge myself with conducting data analytics on text, specifically twitter tweets on #DonaldTrump, extracting the most popular words people associated him with and the sentiment with how they thought of him.

## Downloading Dataset

The dataset I used was USA 2020 Political Tweets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets?resource=download)
